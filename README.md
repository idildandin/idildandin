Project Title: Analysis of Spotify Listening Habits Based on Weather Conditions

Project Objective:
This project aims to understand how my music preferences change according to weather conditions by analyzing my Spotify listening history and weather data. The analysis will focus on how features like genres, energy levels, and tempo of the music I listen to differ under various weather conditions, such as sunny, rainy, or cloudy days.

Data Sources:
Spotify Data: Listening history (song name, artist, genre, listening time) will be retrieved using the Spotify API.
Weather Data: Weather information (e.g., sunny, rainy, temperature) for listening dates will be obtained using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Due to privacy concerns, the collected data will not be shared, but the code and visualizations used for the analysis will be made available.
Steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Retrieving and organizing listening history using the Spotify API.
Collecting and matching weather data with listening dates using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Visualization and Analysis:
Visualizing distributions of music genres, energy, and tempo based on daily weather conditions.
Performing comparative analyses of weather conditions and music preferences.

Reporting Results:
Providing a detailed explanation of changes in listening habits.
Presenting findings with visualizations.
Tools and Technologies:

Python Libraries:
spotipy: To fetch data from the Spotify API.
requests: To retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
pandas: For data cleaning and organization.
matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and executing analyses and code.
GitHub: For sharing code and tracking project progress.

Planned Timeline:
Initial Analysis and Data Cleaning: December 5, 2024
Visualization: December 15, 2024
Final Report and Presentation: January 5, 2025
